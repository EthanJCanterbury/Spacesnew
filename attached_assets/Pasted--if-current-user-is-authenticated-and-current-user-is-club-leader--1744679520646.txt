editor height and web view display fix
18 minutes ago
gallery web spaces public sharing page design
11 hours ago
I can see the issue with the editor and web view being cut off at the bottom. This is often a CSS height issue. Let's fix this in both template files to ensure the editor takes up the full available height.

I'll help you fix the editor height issue. Looking at the files, there seems to be a CSS height problem in both the editor and web view templates.

Let's modify the relevant CSS to ensure the editor takes up the full available height:

static/css/editor.css
static/css/python-editor.css
These changes should fix the height issues by:

Making sure the body has full viewport height without margins or padding
Setting the editor container to take the full viewport height
Ensuring the main content area is sized correctly with flexbox
Making the split layout take the full available height
Calculating the height of the editor main area to account for the header

its still weirdly cut off

I see the issue with the editor being cut off. Let's make additional CSS adjustments to ensure both the editor and web view take up the full available height. Here's a more comprehensive fix:

static/css/editor.css
static/css/python-editor.css
These changes address the editor height issue by:

Setting explicit 100vh height on the editor container
Adding proper flex properties to ensure child elements expand correctly
Setting min-height: 0 on flex children to allow them to shrink when needed
Making the CodeMirror instance flex-grow to fill available space
Making sure overflow is properly handled to prevent scrollbars when not needed
This should fix the cutting off issue by ensuring all containers take the full available height and the editor properly expands to fill its container.

same issue! I think you just need to adjust the code editor height and preview height

I'll help you fix the height issue completely. The problem seems to be that we need a more comprehensive approach to ensure both the editor and preview panes take up the entire available height. Let's make these CSS adjustments:

static/css/editor.css
static/css/python-editor.css
These changes take a more structured approach to the layout:

Using absolute positioning for the main components to ensure they take up the full available space
Making sure the height calculations are precise by setting both top and bottom positions
Adjusting the layout to account for the fixed-height elements like headers and status bars
Ensuring iframes and the CodeMirror editor take the full available space in their containers
Using viewport height properly to account for the entire screen
The approach should fix the cutting-off issues by using absolute positioning to create a more reliable layout that doesn't depend on flex growing/shrinking behaviors that can sometimes be unpredictable.

now the tabs are not visible

I can see the issue - the file tabs aren't visible in the editor. Let's fix this by modifying the CSS to ensure the tabs appear correctly.

static/css/editor.css
static/css/python-editor.css
These changes will:

Make the file tabs visible by fixing their z-index and positioning
Add proper styling to the tabs including active state highlighting
Make room for the tabs in the editor pane
Ensure tabs work in both standard and Python editor views

the tabs need to be above the code editor and not overlapping. Also this happens when shortcuts is clicked

I'll fix both the CSS issues with the tabs overlapping the editor and the JavaScript error with the invalid selector. Let me address them one by one:

First, let's fix the CSS to position the tabs correctly above the code editor:
static/css/editor.css
Now let's fix the JavaScript error with the invalid selector in main.js:
static/js/main.js
These changes will:

Remove the padding-top from editor panes since we'll position the CodeMirror editor correctly
Fix the file tabs height and ensure they have consistent spacing
Position the CodeMirror editor below the tabs (40px from the top)
Fix the JavaScript error by checking if the href is just '#' before trying to use it as a selector

I'll fix the tab scrolling issue in the editor so you can see all tabs and the Git button. The issue is that the tabs need to have proper overflow handling with horizontal scrolling enabled.
